-------------------------------[INTEGRITY TESTS]-------------------------------

This log is for a test of a development version of Tapestry, with SHA256 hash:

5e74a90edbaacd8049ff368800967f16b0766c648c28c595474c685e3c4940d5

[PASSED] All files from the results of the recovery mode run were determined to 
match the original test corpus by means of md5 hash comparison.


-------------------------------[SIGNATURE TESTS]-------------------------------
[PASSED] All of the signatures compared in the signature testing were trusted,  

and matched the expected value for their source document.                       

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-----------------------------[ENCRYPTION TESTING]------------------------------

[PASSED] Due to the passing of the Identity Test, it is not necessary to then

test the cryptographic properties of the test blocks - their successful

decryption is implied by the passage of the identity test.



------------------------[RECOVERY FILE STRUCTURE TEST]-------------------------
[PASSED] No structural changes detected in the recovery file generated by the
code under test. This indicates that the version under test is non-breaking.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


--------------------------[COMPRESSION EFFICACY TEST]--------------------------
[PASSED] All files generated are smaller than their original blocksize.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


------------------------[INCLUSIVE/EXCLUSIVE COMPARISON]-----------------------
[PASSED] The output of the Inclusive Mode run was larger than the Key

Generation Mode Run. This indicates that the inclusive mode is likely working

correctly
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------[KEY IMPORT/EXPORT TEST]----------------------------
[PASSED] The expected keyfiles were located and imported successfully.
