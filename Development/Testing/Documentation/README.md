# Tapestry/Testing Documentation Repo
The documentation contained in this directory is intended to make clear the purpose, functionality, and use of the Tapestry Testing Framework. Like all good messes, we made this one ourselves out of largely stock python capabilities, and it has some idiosyncracies as a result. We also have `TESTING.md`, which details ways to use these tests in automation in both broad and example cases, to facilitate your own development, and the creation of the rest of the testing environment.

If you're a Tapestry user and not looking to start writing code for the project, most of the test information might not be that useful. That said, I would still check out `METHODOLOGY.md` for an overview of what decisions were made in the testing process, and why.

As always, we encourage you not to take our word for anything. This repo will always have the test framework and the current source for the release version of Tapestry, so that you can run the tests yourself.

The rest of the files in this directory all correspond to a particular file in the `tests` folder, and describe the functionality of the tests contained therein.
