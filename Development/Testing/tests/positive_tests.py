This script is a component of the Tapestry project's testing framework.
Specifically, this component defines all the unit tests which constitute
positive controls; those whose outcome indicates something is designing
in an expected way. As a general rule new tests of this type should be
added into testing prior to the development of the corresponding
features. Ideally, coverage should be as high as possible with at least
one test for each function or class method in the program.
