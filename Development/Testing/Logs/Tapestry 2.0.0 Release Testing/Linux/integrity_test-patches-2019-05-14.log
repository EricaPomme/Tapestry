-------------------------------[INTEGRITY TESTS]-------------------------------

This log is for a test of a development version of Tapestry, with SHA256 hash:

4209d3337fe853b199b69ca2a1abf1b3784ae11dbe30b39c76c63cbe8fc2b0f9


Which relies on the classes library with hash:

eb780b9495e76005a8ff86c5cfd359c0a0f7473482757369ab8d55305c4b2f84

[PASSED] All files from the results of the recovery mode run were determined to 
match the original test corpus by means of md5 hash comparison.


-------------------------------[SIGNATURE TESTS]-------------------------------
[PASSED] All of the signatures compared in the signature testing were trusted,

    and matched the expected value for their source document.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-----------------------------[ENCRYPTION TESTING]------------------------------

    [PASSED] Due to the passing of the Identity Test, it is not necessary to then

    test the cryptographic properties of the test blocks - their successful

    decryption is implied by the passage of the identity test.



--------------------------[COMPRESSION EFFICACY TEST]--------------------------
[PASSED] All files generated are smaller than their original blocksize.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


------------------------[INCLUSIVE/EXCLUSIVE COMPARISON]-----------------------
[PASSED] The output of the Inclusive Mode run was larger than the Key

    Generation Mode Run. This indicates that the inclusive mode is likely working

    correctly
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------[KEY IMPORT/EXPORT TEST]----------------------------
[PASSED] The expected keyfiles were located and imported successfully.
