-------------------------------[INTEGRITY TESTS]-------------------------------

This log is for a test of a development version of Tapestry, with SHA256 hash:

f2c93c29b07d10afc03d92ad044d0428d1b2df8f16b921214cb7dee5cc1f9317


Which relies on the classes library with hash:

49f5934fc201f90323d072dc056ce3bfe25458b4e69905db600ac174f3902ba4

[PASSED] All files from the results of the recovery mode run were determined to 
match the original test corpus by means of md5 hash comparison.


-------------------------------[SIGNATURE TESTS]-------------------------------
[PASSED] All of the signatures compared in the signature testing were trusted,  

    and matched the expected value for their source document.                       

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-----------------------------[ENCRYPTION TESTING]------------------------------

    [PASSED] Due to the passing of the Identity Test, it is not necessary to then

    test the cryptographic properties of the test blocks - their successful

    decryption is implied by the passage of the identity test.



--------------------------[COMPRESSION EFFICACY TEST]--------------------------
[PASSED] All files generated are smaller than their original blocksize.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


------------------------[INCLUSIVE/EXCLUSIVE COMPARISON]-----------------------
[PASSED] The output of the Inclusive Mode run was larger than the Key

    Generation Mode Run. This indicates that the inclusive mode is likely working

    correctly
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------[KEY IMPORT/EXPORT TEST]----------------------------
[PASSED] The expected keyfiles were located and imported successfully.
