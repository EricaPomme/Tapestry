# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |

| 2.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 2.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If the risk us backup integrity compromise, such as:
- Unauthorized read from a tapestry backup, or;
- Unauthorized signing/modification of a tapestry backup

Please contact securty@kenshosec.com rather than opening a ticket, due to the potentially sensitive nature of such information.

For all other security issues (privesc, etc), a typical issue ticket would suffice.

Tapestry is not covered by a formal bug bounty program, but we encourage research into its security implications and will not prosecute in the event vulnerabilities are found.
