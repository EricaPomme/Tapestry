# Just a simple tool for making a corpus of compressible files of some given bounds.
# Properly maintained outside this repo as a scriptlet, but included here for clarity
# This version was tweaked specifically for use with Tapestry. If desired, the general solution can be provided.
# This script is not multiplatform; it's dependant on linux.
